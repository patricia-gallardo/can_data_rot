                        <txtmark>
                            <p>Framework agreement with a single operator.</p>
                            <p>Duration of the framework agreement: Duration in year(s): 4.</p>
                            <p>Justification for a framework agreement, the duration of which exceeds four years: It is
                                a considerable investment for a new administrative service provider to develop the
                                necessary functional and technical competence which is specialised for the system which
                                shall be administered.
                            </p>
                            <p>The amount will normally be several man labour years for up to 2 years. In addition a new
                                administrative service provider must establish routines and processes in accordance with
                                the contract requirements and the customer's use of the framework and system must be
                                understood and anchored. If these costs cannot be divided over a sufficiently long
                                contract period, it will be difficult for others than the established service provider
                                to win an administration contract.
                            </p>
                            <p>In order to ensure access to competence in order to get a new administrative service
                                provider, NAV will ensure access to competence for assistance for the new administrative
                                service provider for a period of 2 years. Such transition contracts also help to ensure
                                a real competition for the administrative contracts.
                            </p>
                            <p>These are very comprehensive contracts, and service providers must make considerable
                                investments, which can be said to have a depreciation period over the whole of the
                                contract period of 4+1+1 years, in order to fulfil the contracts. A contract period of
                                4+1+1 years has been chosen in order to ensure competition.

                            <p>The aim is to enter into a maintenance contract and framework agreement for further

                            <p>The annual value of the agreement will vary, but the extent is expected to be from 10 000
                                000 to 20 000 000 NOK per annum.
